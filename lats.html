    <h1>Upper Trapezius (Upper Traps):</h1>
    <p>
        The upper trapezius, or upper traps, is a large, triangular muscle located at the upper back and neck area.<br>
        It plays a crucial role in shoulder elevation, neck stability, and movement control. Here’s a <br>
         breakdown of its key functions (Shoulder Elevation,Scapular 
        Stabilization,Neck Support,Assisting in <br>Lifting Movements,Maintaining Posture,Facilitating Overhead Movements)<br>
        
        <h2>Exercises that Target the Upper Trapezius:</h2>
        - Shrugs: Hold dumbbells or a barbell and shrug your shoulders upward toward your ears, focusing on the upper traps.<br>
        - Upright Rows: Use a barbell or dumbbells to pull upward toward your chin, keeping elbows high to engage the traps.<br>
        - Face Pulls: Use a rope attachment on a cable machine, pulling toward your face to target the upper traps and shoulders.<br>
        - Farmer's Carry: Hold heavy weights in each hand and walk while keeping your shoulders engaged and stable.<br>
        - Overhead Press: Press a barbell or dumbbells overhead, engaging the upper traps to stabilize the shoulders.<br>
    </p>

  <div class="Physique">
    <h1>Middle Trapezius (Middle Traps):</h1>
<p>
    The middle trapezius, or middle traps, is located in the center of the trapezius muscle,<br>
     spanning across the upper back. It plays a crucial role in scapular retraction, shoulder stability,<br> 
     and maintaining proper posture. Here’s a breakdown of its key functions (Scapular Retraction,Shoulder <br>
    Stabilization,Postural Support,Supporting Shoulder Movements,Preventing Rounded Shoulders,<br>
    Enhancing Upper Back Strength)<br>
    
    <h2>Exercises that Target the Middle Trapezius:</h2>
    - Face Pulls: Use a cable machine with a rope attachment and pull toward your face, focusing on squeezing the shoulder blades.<br>
    - T-Raises: Lie face down on an incline bench and raise your arms out to the sides in a "T" shape, engaging the middle traps.<br>
    - Seated Rows: Use a cable or resistance band to pull toward your torso, keeping shoulder blades retracted.<br>
    - Reverse Fly: With dumbbells, hinge forward and raise your arms out to the sides, squeezing the shoulder blades together.<br>
    - Bent-Over Rows: Use a barbell or dumbbells, rowing toward your waist while engaging the middle traps.<br>

        <h1>Lower Trapezius (Lower Traps):</h1>
<p>
    The lower trapezius, or lower traps, is a muscle located in the lower portion of the trapezius, <br>
     extending down the middle of the back. It plays a crucial role in scapular<br>
    depression, shoulder stability, and posture. Here’s a breakdown of its key functions (Scapular Depression,Shoulder <br>
    Stabilization,Supporting Posture,Assisting in Overhead Movements,Reducing Shoulder Impingement,<br>
    Enhancing Spinal Alignment)<br>
    
    <h2>Exercises that Target the Lower Trapezius:</h2>
    - Y-Raises: Lie face down on an incline bench and raise your arms overhead in a "Y" shape to target the lower traps.<br>
    - Prone Cobra: Lie face down, lift your chest and arms off the ground, squeezing your shoulder blades together.<br>
    - Face Pulls with Scapular Depression: Use a cable machine and pull toward your face while actively depressing your scapula.<br>
    - Straight Arm Pull-Downs: Use a cable machine to pull the bar down with straight arms, engaging the lower traps.<br>
    - Overhead Shrugs: Hold dumbbells or a barbell overhead and shrug upward, focusing on lower trap activation.<br>

        <h1>Latissimus Dorsi (Lats):</h1>
<p>
    The latissimus dorsi, commonly referred to as the lats, is a large, broad muscle that covers the lower<br>
    and middle part of the back.<br>
    It plays a crucial role in shoulder movement, posture, and pulling strength. Here’s a breakdown of its key functions <br>
    (Shoulder Extension,Adduction and Internal Rotation,Stabilizing the Spine,Supporting Pulling Movements,<br>
    Improving Posture,Assisting in Deep Breathing)<br>
    
    <h2>Exercises that Target the Latissimus Dorsi:</h2>
    - Pull-Ups: Grip a bar with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width and pull yourself up, engaging the lats.<br>
    - Lat Pulldowns: Use a cable machine to pull the bar down toward your chest, focusing on squeezing the lats.<br>
    - Rows: Use dumbbells, a barbell, or a cable machine to row towards your torso, activating the lats with each pull.<br>
    - Straight Arm Pulldowns: Stand facing a cable machine and pull the bar down with straight arms, isolating the lats.<br>
    - Dumbbell Pullovers: Lie on a bench and extend a dumbbell over your head, pulling it back to engage the lats.<br>
