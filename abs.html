    <h1>Obliques:</h1>
      <p>The obliques are the muscles on the sides of your abdomen. They play a key role in several important functions <br>related to movement,
         stability, and posture. Here's a breakdown of their main functions(Torso Rotation,<br> Lateral Flexion ,Core Stability, Improved Posture, Breathing
          , Protection for Internal Organs and <br>Facilitating Functional Movements )

          
       <h2> Exercises that Target the Obliques:</h2>
        - Russian Twists: Sit with your legs bent and rotate your torso from side to side.<br>
        - Side Planks: Hold a plank position on your side to engage your obliques.<br>
        - Bicycle Crunches: Perform crunches while twisting your torso to bring your opposite elbow to yo aur knee.<br>

      <h1>Transverse Abdominis (TVA):</h1>
        <p>      
            The transverse abdominis (TVA) is the deepest muscle layer in your abdomen. It plays a crucial role in core <br>
            stability, posture, and movement control. Here’s a breakdown of its key functions( Core Stabilization,Pressure <br>
             Regulation,Posture Support,Breathing,Protection for Internal Organs,Facilitating Functional Movements<br>
            
             <h2>Exercises that Target the Transverse Abdominis:</h2>
            - Planks: Hold a plank position while engaging your core, pulling your belly button toward your spine to activate the TVA.<br>
            - Dead Bug: Lie on your back, extending opposite arm and leg while keeping your core stable.<br>
            - Stomach Vacuum: Exhale fully and pull your belly button in towards your spine to directly target the TVA.<br>
            - Bird Dog: Extend one arm and the opposite leg while keeping your torso stable and avoiding rotation.<br>
            - Leg Raises: Lift your legs while engaging your core to prevent your lower back from arching.<br></p>

      <h1>Rectus Abdominis:</h1>
<p>
    The rectus abdominis is the most superficial muscle layer in your abdomen, often referred to as the "six-pack" muscle.<br>
     It plays a key role in trunk flexion, stabilization, and core strength. Here’s a breakdown of its main functions<br>
     (Trunk Flexion,Spinal Stability,Core Strengthening,Assisting in Breathing,Protecting Internal Organs<br>
     ,Supporting Posture)<br>
    
    <h2>Exercises that Target the Rectus Abdominis:</h2>
    - Crunches: Lie on your back with knees bent, lifting your shoulders off the ground while engaging your abs.<br>
    - Sit-Ups: Start lying down and lift your torso up toward your knees for full trunk flexion.<br>
    - Leg Raises: Raise your legs while engaging your abs, preventing your lower back from arching.<br>
    - Bicycle Crunches: Lie on your back and rotate your torso, bringing opposite elbow and knee together.<br>
