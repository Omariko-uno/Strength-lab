    <h1>Triceps Long Head:</h1>
<p>      
    The triceps long head is one of the three muscles that make up the triceps brachii, located at the back of your upper arm.<br>
     It is the largest head and plays a significant role in elbow extension and shoulder movement. Here’s a breakdown of <br>
     its key functions (Elbow Extension, Shoulder Extension, Arm Stabilization, Upper Body Strength, Posture Support,<br>
     Facilitating Pushing Movements).<br>
    
    <h2>Exercises that Target the Triceps Long Head:</h2>
    - Close-Grip Bench Press: Perform a bench press with a narrow hand placement to engage the triceps long head more effectively.<br>
    - Tricep Dips: Use parallel bars or a bench to lower and raise your body, targeting the triceps, especially the long head.<br>
    - Overhead Tricep Extension: Hold a dumbbell or barbell overhead and lower it behind your head to engage the long head.<br>
    - Skull Crushers: Lie on a bench and lower a barbell or dumbbells towards your forehead, extending the arms to work the triceps.<br>
    - Tricep Kickbacks: Bend over and extend a dumbbell backward to target the long head of the triceps.<br>

    <h1>Triceps Lateral Head:</h1>
    <p>      
        The triceps lateral head is one of the three muscles that make up the triceps brachii, located on the outer<br>
        part of the upper arm. It is involved in extending the elbow joint and plays a key role in arm strength and<br>
         stability. Here’s a breakdown of its key functions (Elbow Extension, Arm Stabilization, Upper Body Strength,<br>
          Push Movements, Improving Arm Definition, Assisting with Heavy Lifting).<br>
        
        <h2>Exercises that Target the Triceps Lateral Head:</h2>
        - Close-Grip Push-ups: Perform push-ups with your hands placed closer together to emphasize the lateral head of the triceps.<br>
        - Tricep Pushdowns: Use a cable machine with a bar or rope attachment, pushing the weight down while keeping your<br>
         elbows tight to your body.<br>
        - Overhead Tricep Extensions: Hold a dumbbell or barbell overhead and lower it behind your head, then extend it back up <br>
        to target the lateral head.<br>
        - Diamond Push-ups: Position your hands in a diamond shape beneath your chest to shift more focus to the triceps lateral head.<br>
        - Dips: Use parallel bars or a bench, lower your body and push back up, with an emphasis on the lateral head for stronger extension.<br>

        <h1>Triceps Medial Head:</h1>
        <p>
            The medial head of the triceps is one of the three muscle heads in your upper arm. It plays a crucial role in elbow <br>
            extension, stability, and supporting arm strength. Here’s a breakdown of its key functions (Elbow Extension,Joint <br>
            Stabilization,Supporting Strength in Pushing Movements,Preventing Arm Fatigue,Assisting in Low-Resistance<br>Activities,
            Enhancing Overall Tricep Definition)<br>
            
            <h2>Exercises that Target the Medial Head of the Triceps:</h2>
            - Close-Grip Bench Press: Keep your hands close together on the bar, engaging the triceps as you press up.<br>
            - Tricep Pushdowns: Use a cable machine with a rope attachment, focusing on keeping elbows close to the torso.<br>
            - Skull Crushers: Bring the bar close to your forehead while extending fully to engage the medial head.<br>
            - Overhead Tricep Extension: Use dumbbells or cables, fully extending the arms overhead.<br>
            - Diamond Push-Ups: Place hands close together in a diamond shape to put more emphasis on the triceps.<br>
